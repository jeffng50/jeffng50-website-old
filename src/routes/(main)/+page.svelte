			like just tell me, yeah just that. For example, you can approach me wanting to make a website,
			commission art (prob not because i'm super new), or just hang out. I am super down to boothing
			so if any of y'all need a helper and comfortable with me helping do 100% tell me. Also I want
			to make some new friends, as being an adult, it's super duper hard to make friends, and I'm
			always up to broaden my social circle, like I really need more friends T^T thanks for reading
			so far and if you're reading this, might as well just reach out to me as I guess you're
			interested? hehe
